# Game Design Document

>**Game Design Document Outline**

*A game design document is a blueprint from which a game is to be built.  As such, every single detail necessary to build the game should be addressed.  The larger the team and the longer the design and development cycle, the more critical is the need.  For your purpose, the intent is to capture as much as possible of your design.  I want you to think big…bigger than what you are able to develop.  I also want you to be clear about what the software delivers and what the design entails.  My recommendation is that you define the ultimate game and then clarify what it is that you have developed.  If you are finding it too difficult to do that, you may produce too documents.*

How does the game flow for the game player?

### Mechanics

What are the rules to the game, both implicit and explicit.  This is the model of the universe that the game works under.  Think of it as a simulation of a world, how do all the pieces interact?  This actually can be a very large section.

Each level should include a synopsis, the required introductory material (and how it is provided), the objectives, and the details of what happens in the level.  Depending on the game, this may include the physical description of the map, the critical path that the player needs to take, and what encounters are important or incidental.

### Training level

## Interface

### Help System

## Artificial Intelligence

### Opponent and Enemy AI

The active opponent that plays against the game player and therefore requires strategic decision making.

### Non-combat and Friendly Characters

### Support AI
